**Tattoo Design and Information**


Hello! My name is David and I wanted to create this page to help me in explaining how I want the design to be.


**Main Design**

**Bunny Details**

I would like the bunny to look as identical to this image above as possible.

**Dog Details**

For the dog I would like for it to have a little bit more realism compared to the bunny but not too much of a difference. I want the dog to be inspired by my childhood dog, pictures below;
