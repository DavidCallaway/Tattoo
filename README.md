**Tattoo Design and Information**


Hello! My name is David and I wanted to create this page to help me in explaining how I want the design to be.


**Main Design**

**Bunny Details**

I would like the bunny to look as identical to this image above as possible.

**Dog Details**

For the dog I would like for it to have a little bit more realism compared to the bunny but not too much of a difference. I want the dog to be inspired by my childhood dog, pictures below;

**Main comments and wants**

I want the bunny to represent a filling of life and joy through the color that it brings to the dog, when the bunny is colored in, it should be white and i want the vibrant color of the bunny to start to leak into the dog, this representation is very important to me, the dog is also white as in the pictures.
